# DSA Problems Collection

This repository contains a collection of Data Structures and Algorithms problems solved as part of my DSA class. The problems cover a wide range of topics, including but not limited to, time complexity, sorting algorithms, graph algorithms, dynamic programming, and data structure operations like heaps and hash tables.

## Overview

The problems in this repository are implemented in Java and are designed to provide practical experience with different algorithms and data structures. Each problem is contained in its own Java file and includes a brief description of the problem statement, the algorithm used, and the date of completion.

### Topics Covered

- **Time Complexity Analysis**: Understanding how the runtime of an algorithm scales with the size of the input.
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Implementation and analysis of various sorting techniques like QuickSort and MergeSort.
- **Graph Algorithms**: Exploration of graph traversal and shortest path algorithms, including Floyd's Algorithm.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Solving problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and storing their solutions.
- **Data Structures**: Operations on various data structures like heaps, with an emphasis on heap operations and linear probing in hash tables.

## Getting Started

To run any of the programs in this repository, you will need a Java development environment set up on your machine. This includes having the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed and properly configured. 

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK), version 8 or higher.
- A Java IDE (Integrated Development Environment) such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or simply a text editor like VSCode coupled with terminal commands.

### Running the Programs

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the files directly.
2. Open your preferred Java IDE and import the project, or navigate to the directory containing the program files in your terminal.
3. To compile a program, use the following command in the terminal:
   ```
   javac FileName.java
   ```
   Replace `FileName` with the actual name of the Java file you wish to compile.
4. To run the compiled program, use the following command:
   ```
   java FileName
   ```
   Ensure you're not including the `.class` extension when running the program.

### Example

To compile and run the `Main_Hw2_1.java` program, navigate to the directory containing the file and execute:
```
javac Main_Hw2_1.java
java Main_Hw2_1
```
